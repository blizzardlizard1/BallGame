This is a project I worked on for my Math Fundamentals for Games class. Its a fun physics game using dot product, and you can drag and shoot a ball in a circle. You can mess with the gravity of the ball, and it grows inside the circle too, like in those videos on Tiktok. Family Guy clips not included! 

All the code is in one file, so you can download and run the BallGame.java file, and you'll get a window popup.
